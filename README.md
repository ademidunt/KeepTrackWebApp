### Using Application

To begin users will see a page that does not display any tasks. Users can click thw add button on the top right to add a tasK. Clicking this button will open a form where users can write a name for a task, the date and time of the task as well as set a reminder for the task. Once the user saves the task it will be added to a task list

Users can add as many tasks as they want. Tasks with a reminder will have a green boarder, users can double click on the task if they would like to remove the reminder. Users can use the red X beside the task to delete task from list.

### Design Decisions 

There were a few design decisions that had to be made when creating this application. 

A notble decision was to use function based companents as opposed to class basec components when developing this application. I chose to do this because functional compoenents have a shorter and simpler framework than class components, thus using functional components as opposed to class components would make my application easier to understand, develop and test.
